# SportPerformance-Redux
 
SportPerformance is an iOS tracking app built with Swift and SwiftUI for its user interface. It follows a Redux-inspired MVVM-like architecture with a central Store, actions and reducers, using Combine for handling asynchronous streams and state updates. Data persistence is handled both locally via Core Data and remotely via Firebase Firestore.
